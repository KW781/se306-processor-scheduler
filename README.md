# Project Description
This project is part of the SOFTENG306 design course at the University of Auckland and uses the fundementals of artificial intelligence and parallel processing power to solve a difficult scheduling problem. 

Our code stems off developing a simple branch-and-bound type algorithm that solves a scheduling problem from a hypothetical *client*. Following this initial principle, the goal of this project aims to achieve the highest possible performance through parallelisation and visualise this process.
