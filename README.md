# Project Description
This project is part of the SOFTENG306 design course at the University of Auckland and uses the fundementals of artificial intelligence and parallel processing power to solve a difficult scheduling problem. 

Our code stems off developing a simple branch-and-bound type algorithm that solves a scheduling problem given from a hypothetical *client*. Following this initial principle, the goal of this project aims to achieve the highest possible performance through parallelisation and visualise this process. 

## üëã About Us
We are **Parallels** (Team 16), a group of software engineering students at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz) aiming to develop and implement a maintainable and high-performance software algorithm.
